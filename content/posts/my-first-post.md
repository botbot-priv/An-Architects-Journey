## For Bibin

You are only in control of what you do and how you feel about a situation and not in charge of the outcome.

You cannot control how others are. It is outside your influence.

So focus on doing the best job you can, enough to make yourself happy and if the result does not work out, it is outside of your influence.

Find something that motivates and interests you and make yourself happy and do more of that.
