Be intentional
- About the things I do
- About the things I own
- About how I react to situations

Be grounded
- Be present and live in the moment.
- Do not be distracted. 

Start with a goal in mind.
- Always think about the end goal.

Manage the energy I use

Give back by actively listening and asking good questions.
