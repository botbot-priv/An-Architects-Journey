Well maybe not exactly the same... But as the famous saying goes...
> "History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes."

Having re-read and reflected on this article ([On LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/setting-teams-up-success-luke-bottomley%3FtrackingId=RIHvuXRHRUGxE52EhpC9xA%253D%253D/?trackingId=RIHvuXRHRUGxE52EhpC9xA%3D%3D)  / [On my blog](https://botbot-priv.github.io/posts/setting-teams-up-for-success/)) I wrote in 2022 it became clear that the fundamentals of how to deliver value with Salesforce (and projects in general) are still the same.

- (Well) define the business problem you are trying to solve and/or the business value you are trying to achieve.
- Prioritise, and I mean really prioritise, on what you are trying to deliver.
- Make sure that this goal is transparent.
- Organise your teams around achieving that value.
- Design your architecture to solve that problem. 
- Build a high performing team that is empowered to deliver that value.

In my latest [blog](https://botbot-priv.github.io/posts/great-salesforce-architecture/)/ LinkedIn, I discuss why these fundamentals are essential to achieving great Salesforce Architecture.
